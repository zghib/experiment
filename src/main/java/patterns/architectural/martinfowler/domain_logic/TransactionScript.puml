note right of [Recognition Service]
 Most business applications can be thought of as a series of transactions.
 A transaction may view some information as organized in a particular way,
 another will make changes to it. Each interaction between a client system and a
 server system contains a certain amount of logic. In some cases this can be as
 simple as displaying information in the database. In others it may involve many
 steps of validations and calculations. A Transaction Script organizes all this
 logic primarily as a single procedure, making calls directly to the database or
 through a thin database wrapper. Each transaction will have its own
 Transaction Script, although common subtasks can be broken into subprocedures.

 Your task is to get the input, interrogate the database,
 munge, and save your results to the database
